      <h2>Coxs-Bazar:</h2>
      <div class="rana4">
          <p>The beach in Cox's Bazar is sandy and has a gentle slope and with an unbroken length of 155 km (96 mi) it is often termed the "longest natural unbroken sea beach" in the world. There are many disputes over that claim since the Federal Republic of Brazil has over 4,500 miles of coastline on the South Atlantic which covers sand beaches such as Copacabana in the State of Rio de Janeiro. [2][3][4] It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the divisional headquarter of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower". Another old name was "Palongkee".</p>
